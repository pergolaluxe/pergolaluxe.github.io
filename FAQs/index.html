<h1>Pergola Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<div class="faq-title"> 
<h2>
What is the difference between a pergola and a gazebo?
</h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
<p>
A pergola is an open structure with a slatted roof, usually supported by 
columns or posts. It provides partial shade and serves as a decorative element in 
outdoor spaces. In contrast, a gazebo has a solid roof and enclosed sides, offering 
full coverage and protection from the elements. Gazebos are often used as standalone 
structures for outdoor dining or relaxation, while pergolas are more commonly used to 
define outdoor spaces or as decorative additions to gardens and patios.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-title">
<h2>
Can pergolas have a solid roof?
</h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
<p>
Yes, pergolas can have a solid roof, although traditionally they are designed with an open, 
slatted roof to allow sunlight and airflow. However, modern pergola designs often incorporate 
solid roofs made from materials like polycarbonate panels, metal, or wood. These solid roof 
pergolas offer increased protection from rain, sun, and other weather elements, making them 
suitable for year-round use and creating a more sheltered outdoor space.
</p>
<p>
Louvered pergolas, also known as adjustable or motorized pergolas, are incredibly versatile 
outdoor structures. Their louvers, or slats, can be adjusted to control the amount of sunlight 
and shade, providing flexibility based on weather conditions or personal preference. This 
versatility allows you to enjoy an open-air experience on sunny days by opening the louvers for 
sunlight and ventilation. Conversely, you can close the louvers partially or fully to create a 
shaded and protected area during hot summer days or light rain. Some louvered pergolas even come 
with motorized systems, allowing you to adjust the louvers with the touch of a button for added 
convenience. Overall, louvered pergolas offer a blend of functionality, style, and adaptability, 
making them a popular choice for outdoor living spaces.
</p>
</div>

<div class="faq-title">
<h2>
How much do pergolas cost?
</h2>
</div>

<div class="basic-paragraph">
<p>
The cost of pergolas can vary widely depending on several factors such as size, materials, 
design complexity, and installation requirements. On the lower end, a simple DIY pergola kit 
made of pressure-treated wood or vinyl can range from $500 to $2,000 for a small to medium-sized 
structure. These basic pergolas typically come with pre-cut components and straightforward assembly 
instructions, making them more budget-friendly.
</p>
<p>
As you move up in quality and size, the cost increases accordingly. Custom-built pergolas made of 
higher-end materials like cedar, redwood, or composite materials can range from $2,000 to $10,000 
or more for larger and more intricate designs. These custom pergolas often include features such 
as decorative elements, sturdy construction, and professional installation services, which 
contribute to their higher price point.
</p>
<p>
Premade pergola kits available at places like Costco or Home Depot offer a convenient and 
cost-effective option for homeowners looking to add a pergola to their outdoor space. These 
kits are designed to simplify the installation process and provide a structured framework for 
DIY enthusiasts or those hiring a contractor. Here are some key points to consider about these 
premade pergola kits:
</p>
<p>
Design and Size Options: These kits often come in standard sizes, such as 10'x10', 12'x12', or 
14'x14', with various design styles ranging from traditional to modern. While the designs may be 
simpler compared to custom-built pergolas, they still offer aesthetic appeal and functionality.
</p>
<p>
Materials: Most premade pergola kits are made from durable materials like pressure-treated wood, 
cedar, or vinyl. These materials are chosen for their weather resistance and longevity, ensuring 
that your pergola can withstand outdoor conditions over time.
</p>
<p>
Assembly: One of the main advantages of premade kits is the ease of assembly. They typically come 
with pre-cut and pre-drilled components, along with detailed instructions and hardware, making it 
easier for DIYers to put them together. Some kits may require basic tools and moderate construction 
skills, while others are designed for straightforward assembly.
</p>
<p>
Cost: Premade pergola kits from retailers like Costco or Home Depot are generally more affordable 
compared to custom-built pergolas. Prices can vary based on the size, material, and features of the 
kit, but they often range from a few hundred dollars to a couple of thousand dollars, depending on 
the complexity and quality.
</p>
<p>
Additional Features: Some kits may include optional accessories like canopy covers, lattice panels, 
or post decorations. These add-ons can enhance the functionality and aesthetics of your pergola, 
providing additional shade or privacy as needed.
</p>
<p>
Warranty and Support: Many premade pergola kits come with manufacturer warranties that cover 
defects in materials or workmanship. It's essential to review the warranty terms and any available 
customer support to ensure a smooth installation process and address any issues that may arise.
</p>
<p>
Overall, while there is a wide range of costs associated with pergolas, it's essential to 
weigh your budget, desired features, and aesthetic preferences to find the right pergola
